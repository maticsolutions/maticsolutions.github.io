Scheduling Task

Scheduling is a task our client was spending more than three hours on. This client relied on a third-party scheduling company for managing their student schedules, but the system in place wasn't customizable to their business model. Our client sought a more user-friendly solution that could cater to their unique needs.

At Matic Solutions, we teamed up with our client to dissect the scheduling process and understand every step involved. We recognized the repetitive tasks and manual efforts that went into creating schedules every time. Then, we set out to revolutionize the process through automation.

Our solution was simple yet powerful - an intuitive interface that replicated the exact steps the client took, but in a fraction of the time. The result? A significant reduction in scheduling hours, allowing the client to focus on more strategic aspects of their business.

To demonstrate the impact of this automation, we've put together an example showcasing the initial data from the scheduling website and the final product.

Here is an example of how the data looks when it's not organized:
